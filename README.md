## About :question:
This is a website I created for the course *Information Systems Implementation and Architecture* of my University. This is a re-uploaded repository, because the previous one had many chaotic commit messages (due to my lack of experience at the moment).

## In case you think it is messy :confused:
1. Keep in mind that this was a team project (3 people) but I ended up doing almost **all** the work by myself (Frontend, Backend, Assets).
2. My experience with web development and generally programming at the moment was very small.
3. It was not a full-time project. There were other courses too (with their assignments) that I was busy with. 

### The idea :rocket:
A website that connects customers with barbershops. Specifically, a user can register as customer or barbershop.
- A customer chooses one of the given areas, and see all the available barbershops in this area. Then, he can select one and check its information (street, images, pricing, etc.), so as to make an appointment (day, time, service). The customer can also see other users' reviews (stars & comment), and after his appointment is finished, he can also make a review. A customer also has the ability to see previous bookings.
- A barbershop can check his future and past appointments, and his reviews.
- Both types of users can give feedback or write a complaint about the website application, in a *Contact us* form.

### Technologies :wrench:
As said in the description, the web app is implemented using Java Servlet Pages. The database system was MySQL. The server was provided by our university, and we used WinSCP to upload our files.

### Other information :page_with_curl:
- If you see anywhere `ismgroup26`, this was the team's ID.
- Site is not scalable at all at various screen sizes. I repeat, there wasn't enough time to take care of that too.
- Original repository: https://github.com/DinosXa/e-barber
